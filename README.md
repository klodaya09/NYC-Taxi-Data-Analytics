# NYC Trip Data Analytics Project Using GCP

## Introduction
This project is for learning purposes. With this project you will perform data analysis and develop an analytical pipeline using Google Cloud Platform, Python, Mage AI and Looker Studio.

## Tools Used

1. Coding tool: Python

Google Cloud Platform
1. Google Storage
2. Compute Instance 
3. Google BigQuery
4. Looker Studio

Data Pipeine Tool - https://www.mage.ai/

## About the Dataset
I used the TLC trip record data - https://www.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page

The data I used in my analysis is - https://github.com/klodaya09/NYC-Taxi-Data-Analytics/blob/master/Data/yellow_tripdata.csv

For more information on the dataset you can visit the above website or take a look at this data dictionary - https://github.com/klodaya09/NYC-Taxi-Data-Analytics/blob/master/data_dictionary_trip_records_yellow.pdf
This data dictionary describes the yellow trip data.

## Analysis

I used python to clean and preprocess the data. Used Google cloud services like google storage to store the data, compute engine to develop the ETL pipeline using Mage AI, BigQuery to perform analysis and develop queries and Looker Studio to develop dashboard.

For analysis and running queries on BigQuery I have 10 questions that you can solve and generate insights.

To install python, mage ai and bigquery using the compute engine, you will need to first create a virtual env. in the latest updates.
