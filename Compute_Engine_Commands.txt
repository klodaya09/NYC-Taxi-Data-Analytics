Make sure venv is installed by running:

sudo apt install python3-venv
To create a new virtual environment in a directory named .venv, run:

python3 -m venv .venv
To activate this virtual environment (which modifies the PATH environment variable), run this:

source .venv/bin/activate
Now you can install a library like requests in this virtual environment:

pip install requests
If you want to leave the virtual environment, you can run:

deactivate

pip install mage-ai
mage start project_name

pip install google-cloud
pip install google-cloud-bigquery


if you get dbtypes error

pip install pandas==1.4.1
